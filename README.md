Post-disaster, everyone wishes that if somehow, they could have got some extra time before the disaster reached them, they would have prepared better for it and could have saved lives of their loved ones. So, with HolocaustNet, we try to solve this problem. HolocaustNet tries to saves more lives during a disaster by informing people nearby a disaster-hit area, so that they could have a heads-up on it and save the lives of themselves and their loved ones.

HolocaustNet is a natural disaster managing social network mobile applicaion.

The working of this app goes as follows: -
<ol>
<li>When a disaster hits a particular place, any person at that area can inform others about it by posting about the disaster and sharing his location.</li>
  <li>People nearby to that location, will immediately get a notification regarding the disaster so that they can have sufficient time to save their lives.</li>
  <li>People can also request for help and their location will be displayed on a map in the application. The people nearby them can save them by viewing their current location.</li>
  <li> One can also know the last known location of their loved ones so it would be easier to track them.</li>
  <li> The app will also have a map which the users can access at the time of disaster to see all nearby services, rescue camps, relief camps etc.</li>
  <li> Those willing to provide food/shelter etc. services to the people suffered can show their location on map and affected people can reach them for help.</li>
  <li> One can also know the last known location of their loved ones.</li>
  </ol>
